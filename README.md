# Loan-Amount-Prediction-Portfolio-Analysis
This project analyzes a bank’s loan portfolio to identify the key factors that influence how much customers request in loans. Using 931 customer records, we apply statistical analysis and predictive modeling techniques to determine which variables meaningfully explain loan demand and how these insights can support better lending decisions.
